======FRACTAL_SWEEP_EA======

That one expert advisor is related to the idea of fractals in trading.
It openes position buy/sell in case which fractal has been swept high/low.
If you don`t know what fractals is:
Fractal is the highest/lowest candle among every 5 candles
To say it less complicated it just local high or low.
So when our previous candle sweeps that one fractal => we open position.

If price sweeps low => we buying
If price sweeps high => we selling

Parameters:

RiskRatio % - risk per trade (1% - 1% from your acc balance)

MagicNumber - magic number for position list

_slType - Fixed, Structure, Trailing

Fixed:

Take-Profit size(pips) - size of your tp in pips

Stop-Loss size(pips) - size of your sl in pips

//Fixed stoploss represents default stop-loss you setting in trade properties when you opening the position

Structure:

SlLookBackBars - how many bars back algorithm should look to find where place stop-loss

TpMultiplier - responsible for RR of your trade, for instance script finded where to put stop-loss than it multiplies size of stop-loss by TpMultiplier to find where to put take-profit

//Structure stop-loss finds structure high/low and puts stop-loss right on it.

Trailing:

StartSlSize(pips) - fixed stop-loss size

//Trailing stop-loss moves in the direction of your position (long, short) until it not excecuted 

Fractal forming period - i guess it easy to understand what does it mean. I will develop it in future though you can change your fractal forming period (Nowadays it only 5)

DrawFractals - just draws fractals on the chart

MaxFractalsDrawn - usually you need to put around 700, according to on what amount of data you backtesting
